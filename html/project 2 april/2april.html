                <h1>The experience of US pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago</h1>

                <p>The Camino de Santiago is an increasingly international pilgrimage.
                    More than 50% of the pilgrims that take the road to Santiago de Compostela
                    come from countries outside Spain, and in particular from United States of America.
                    In 2017, pilgrims from the US were the fourth biggest nationality group, 
                    with a total of 17,552 pilgrims from that country taking the Camino de Santiago.
                    And this figure is only expected to increase this year, given that some 11,000 US visitors
                </p> 
                <p> have already picked up their Compostela from the Pilgrim’s Reception Office. Quite a striking 
                    figure when you think that just 10 years ago the number of US pilgrims was generally around the 2,000 mark!
                    People often mention the film The Way, starring Martin Sheen, as one of the main factors that
                    has raised the profile of the Camino in the USA, but it is also true that increasing numbers of
                </p>
                <p> pilgrims cross the Atlantic because they have heard stories about the great experiences of others that
                    have already undertaken the pilgrimage, or because they have been encouraged by a particularly active 
                    Friends of the Camino association called the American Pilgrims on the Camino.
                    Today, on our blog we’re going to share with you the stories of five pilgrims from the United States that have
                    completed the Camino this year, so that you can hear about their experiences first-hand. Our stories come from
                    Cathy Seitchik Díaz (Santa Cruz, California); Denis and Marisa Darch (New York),
                    Thor Mikesell (Oregon) and Grace Helmer (Atlanta, Georgia). Five people of different ages and from various
                    corners of the country with five different stories to tell about how they walked, lived and shared their very own Camino de Santiago.
